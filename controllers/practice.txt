whe  user logged in 
get id from localstorage
for post req parse the id in body

for get req which does not have a body we use concept of headers, we can easily set heeaders in axios

secret key - we encrypt userid to send it to backend so no one can manipulate it
becrypt is one way hash 
so we use token system here with the helpof jsonwebtoken

query = request for result from db or can be action to db
param = parametrs which are exchaned between db and functions or application tools
